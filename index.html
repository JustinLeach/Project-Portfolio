                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Justin Leach and I am currently enrolled in my final semester of the Bachelor of Electronic Systems Engineering Degree Co-op program at Conestoga College. This program has been designed to provide a high amount of 
                     project-based learning with software and hardware, as well as all the theory associated with it.  Almost all of the projects completed in this program require designing and implementing software to control hardware circuits. 
                     We use tools such as multi-meters, oscilloscopes and simulation software to troubleshoot the circuits.  I have learned a mix of programming as well as designing and implementing hardware.<br><br>
                    I have always had a strong interest in electronics and the way machines work. I created my first major project when I was in grade 10 - a 4-bit calculator using digital logic chips and a breadboard. Since then I have made 
                     countless other projects including an FM radio transmitter, RC vehicles, an audio amplifier and a professional Microcontroller breakout board. I have a lot of experience, knowledge and passion for this field and I know I 
                     will continue to learn and contribute throughout my career.  The folloiwng pages showcase some of the many projects I have created.</p>

                    <h2>Embedded Controller PCB</h2>
                    <p>This is one of the projects that I am most proud of to date. In my fourth semester at school, using Altium designer, I designed a professional embedded controller board that would connect to a simple microcontroller board
                         and could be used to control a robot. This board can control a servo motor, stepper motor, 2 DC motors, motor encoders, limit switches, an LCD display, communicate through RS232, operate a CAN bus and record and playback
                    audio all at the same time. It has a built-in switching power supply that can run off 6 to 30 volts and is approximately 95% efficient. This was a very fun project to design and manufacture. It is of a professional standard and 
                    throughout numerous tests, has functioned perfectly.  I really enjoyed creating this project and hope in the future I can do more work similar to this.</p>

                <h2>Test Robot</h2>
                <p>I created this Test Robot in my 5th semester at school. It is a robot that houses the microcontroller board I created the semester before and demonstrates the functionality of the board. The robot has 2 DC motors with encoders to 
                    drive at specific speeds and distances using feedback control theory. The robot also has a stepper and servo motor to direct a built-in camera. The camera is connected to a Raspberry Pi and streamed over wifi to the controlling computer.
                     An Xbox remote connected to the host computer running a program in C code, parses and sends commands to the robot's Raspberry Pi over a websocket. If the connection fails at any point, the robot will stop and terminate the connection.
                      This was one of my favourite projects to create as it was both challenging and fun to complete.</p>

                <h2>Elevator Project</h2>
                <p>This project was done virtually during online school in a group of 3 students during my 6th semester. This project is a small working elevator controlled directly by Raspberry Pi and STM Nucleo development boards being controlled by our website. My team created
                     the website in HTML, CSS, Java Script, PHP and SQL. The Raspberry Pi was running a C++ program written by us to move the elevator between floors by reading the SQL database and then transmitting over a CAN network to the STM Boards. The website
                      itself had a few different pages for logging in, creating an account, moving the elevator, and an 'About the Project' page. There was also a diagnostics page to display everything in the SQL databases and update or insert new entries. </p>

            <h2>RS232 Transceiver</h2>
            <p>I completed this project in my third semester of school and is is the most complex piece of software I have written to date, being over 2000 lines of C code. For this project I needed to program an 
                interface on two computers so that messages could be sent back and forth through RS232. The program opens as a simple menu where the user can choose an option, and then opens into similar sub-menus. Simple text messages can 
                be sent and received as well as audio messages, files and random quotes read from a file. The messages can be encrypted in multiple forms of encryption. The messages can also be compressed to enable large files to send faster.
                 Messages can be sent as a package with a header, giving information about the message.  This enables the receiving station to identify if the message is encrypted or compressed, and will correct small errors in the data. The 
                 receiving station automatically stores all of the messages in a priority queue and organizes all of the contacts in a binary search tree to act as an address book. For this project we also needed to make our own FSK
                  modulators and demodulators to act as modems on either end of the transmission line.</p>

            <h2>Scrolling LED Matrix</h2>
            <p>This project is a scrolling LED board that I completed in my second semester of school. You can enter a string of text into a microcontroller and it will scroll across the LED board. The hardware consists of a decoder which selects 
                the individual rows using transistors and three shift registers to access all 24 columns. I coded the microcontroller to read from an array holding the text information.  It then prints out an increasing amount of the whole array
                 until the whole text has been scrolled. It also flashes one row at a time at around 70 hz so that it appears fully lit up. We completed this project in school and only a few of my classmates were successful. I assisted some of my
                  colleagues to get their project working successfully.  </p>

        <h2>Audio Amplifier</h2>
        <p>This is a three-stage class AB amplifier that I built in my third semester at school. It is a 5 watt amplifier with multiple forms of over-current protection and feedback systems to reduce distortion and possible damage. This was
             a six week project that was planned, calculated, tested and documented to industry standards. The final product works really well and sounds great with a good speaker.</p>

            <h2>Solar Streetlight</h2>
            <p>This project is a solar street light. The project requirements were to design a project that could help the world that was based around a sensor and a microcontroller. I created a streetlight for third world nations without electricity.
                 The light charges during the day and turns on slowly as it gets dark. This is just a proof of concept prototype made from cardboard and the real device would be larger and more durable. One of the teachers at the school
                  appreciated my project personally, as he is originally from a small village in India and didn’t have electricity growing up.
                I enjoyed working on a project with real-life applications.  These are the sorts of projects that I would like to develop throughout my career.

        <h2>Calculator</h2>
        <p>As described in my introduction, here is a photo of a calculator that I designed and built in grade 10. It can add two 3-bit numbers and has a 4-bit output. I was reading a book called “The Way Things Work” and when
             I read about full adders, I was inspired to build a calculator. I used switches as inputs that go into an encoder to convert the numbers to binary. The two binary numbers are then added using a series of digital
              logic gates. The value is then sent to a multiplexer to convert back into a base ten number and is displayed on one of the LEDs.  This was one of my first projects and completely self-taught.</p>

            <p>Another project that I completed in high school, was an analog multimeter. It can measure voltage, current, resistance and magnetism with 2 ranges on the voltage and current settings. Spinning the rotary switch and flipping the 
                toggle switches, changes the measuring mode. The black wire is COM, the red wire is voltage and current and the yellow wire is for resistance. The magnetism is measured with a Hall-effect sensor.

        <h2>Other Robots</h2>
        <p>In grade 9, I made a simple line-following robot. It follows a line on the ground using a comparator chip and some photoresistors. Another robot that I created uses infrared detectors from old VCR players and avoids obstacles 
            by reversing the opposite side motor if a sensor sees an object. It is a simple circuit using an inverter chip to generate the desired frequency of the IR Sensors and to reverse the signals going to the motor H-Bridges.  These first projects
             were completely self-taught and built from spare parts.</p>
